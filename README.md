# lolPix

**Not yet usable!**
This is another try to implement lolPix. This time using Rails and React.

## Development

The project can be imported using RubyMine which will automatically detect run configurations (or at least wil ask to add them).

After running, the server runs at `http://localhost:3000`.
There is a rudimentary start page at `/` and an API for posts at `/api/v1/posts`.

## Things left to cover in this README (ie. TODO)
* Ruby version
* System dependencies
* Configuration
* Database creation
* Database initialization
* How to run the test suite
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
* Deployment instructions
* ...
